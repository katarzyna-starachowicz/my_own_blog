== Blog application (Ruby on Rails 4.2.7)

It's not complicated blog application, but have something more than every tutorial offers:

* services,

* repositories,

* form objects,

* one small extracted query ;)

* modules for routes, nested routes,

* Rspec and Capybara tests.

It uses gems like:

* devise,

* haml,

* rubocop.

And it's not over...
